# cattrack-client-react

Rewite of client using Flux and React.

Broadly based on flux-shell example.

# Usage

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

# Watch

Instead of manually building after each change it's possible to automatically recompile the javascript bundle when files change:

```bash
npm run watch
```
